## The UI flow for the fantasy cricket platform would work as follows:

### Initial Squad Submission Form:
``` Managers start by accessing this form to submit their initial squad. They select 18 players while ensuring the total base price does not exceed 100 Cr.Players are added to the squad, and their status (contested/uncontested) is displayed. If the budget exceeds the limit, the form provides feedback for corrections. Once satisfied, managers submit their squad privately through the form. ```

### Live Auction Interface:
``` Next, managers participate in a live auction for contested players. They place bids with incremental increases depending on the player's current bid value. An auction timer counts down; if no new bid comes in when it hits zero, the player is sold to the highest bidder. The budget is automatically adjusted with each winning bid. ```

### Weekly Transfer Window:
``` During weekends, the transfer window opens for 48 hours. Managers list players for sale and place bids on other managers' players. They are limited to four free bids, with additional bids incurring a cost. When bids are accepted or time expires, transfers are processed, and the interface updates accordingly.```

### Daily Lineup Selection:
``` On a daily basis, managers select their playing XI from their squad, including a Captain and Vice-Captain. The interface shows projected points for each player to assist with selection. Once the lineup is confirmed, it is locked in for the day's matches.```

### Real-Time Scoring Dashboard:
``` As matches are played, this dashboard provides live updates on fantasy points. Points are calculated based on players' performance in the actual IPL matches. Managers can track their team's progress and make strategic decisions for future lineups.```


### Season Conclusion:
``` At the end of the season, the final outcomes are displayed. Managers can see their final standings on the leaderboard, detailed statistics, and how ties are broken. The interface provides a summary of the season and recognizes the winning manager.```

# Throughout each phase, data entered by the managers or generated by the live IPL matches is processed in the backend and reflected in the respective UI components. The flow is designed to be engaging and intuitive, encouraging managers to stay active and make strategic decisions throughout the fantasy cricket season.
